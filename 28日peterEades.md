### 1. Graph Concepts
Matrix data / Short-read graph -> graph
> visualization pipeline:  
> Data set -> Picture -> Human

Faithfulness:  (pic faithfulness == task faithfulness)  
*(different from redability)*
- Information faithfulness: mostly in small graphs, impossible in large graphs.
> Data space D -> Picture space -> Human knoledge space K -> Result space R  
- Task faithfulness: importtant concept, most important type of faithfulness, Distance/Cluster/Neighbourhood faithfulness  
*(measures how well picture represent data, help human understading data)*

**Shape-based faithfulness**  
show the structure of the graph
